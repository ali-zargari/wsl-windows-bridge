### Reddit (r/WSL, r/androiddev):
Title: I created a tool to seamlessly run Windows executables from WSL2 (perfect for Android development!)

After struggling with ADB connection issues between WSL2 and Windows Android emulators, I built WSL-Windows Bridge. It creates transparent wrappers that let you run Windows binaries as if they were Linux commands.

No more:
- TCP/IP configuration
- Port forwarding setup  
- Connection refused errors
- Complex networking

Just:
```
wsl-win-bridge add adb
adb devices  # Works instantly!
```

It's not limited to ADB - works with any Windows executable!
